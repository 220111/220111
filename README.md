### Past Projects
I've worked on a few projects in the past. Most notibly I updated an open-source arduino script for connecting RC Transmitters to Windows computers to support the new arduino editor. I've also worked on a couple of hackathon projects with some friends. Most notibly is of course TinyTV. Check out [my website](https://hmorin.com) for more information and direct links to all of these.
