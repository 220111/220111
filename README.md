# HENRY MORIN

### About
I'm a software engineer currently studying at Rose-Hulman Institute of Technology. I love game development, audio engineering, and web development. Check out [my website](https://hmorin.com) for more information.

### Currently Working On
I'm currently designing a game that blends turn-based RPGs with rhythm games. It's based around collecting synthesizers which are my favorite instrument. Check out my website from time to time to see if i've posted any anouncements.

### Past Projects
I've worked on a few projects in the past. Most notibly I updated an open-source arduino script for connecting RC Transmitters to Windows computers to support the new arduino editor. I've also worked on a couple of hackathon projects with some friends. Most notibly is of course TinyTV. Check out my website for more information and direct links to all of these.
